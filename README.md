# AKS_PrimeTest
AKS Prime Test Python (Not parallelized, easy implementation)

If you are able to parallelize this code please tell me.
I've tryed it with Numpy but I've got an overflow and step 5 was incorrect.


The Programm output primes form n to 1000000.
You can edit the Code to test specific primes.
